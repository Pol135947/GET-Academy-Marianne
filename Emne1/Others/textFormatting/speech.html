I hope you are ready, brother, for a speech five entire years in the making, because I will not show as much mercy as my parents. Their speech was cute in comparison to what I have prepared for you. <i>Crack knuckles</i>

                        I have known you for almost 15 years. Imagine that. You went from a <span class="highlight-text">cute, small child</span>, who could only point with your fingers when you wanted something and who could not eat an ice cream properly. Then, you became an <span class="highlight-text">annoying brat</span> who couldn't keep his mouth shut as you transitioned to become what one may call a teenager. Or in your case, since you started your rebellious years three years earlier, an immature preteen. Miraculously, I finished with a somewhat tolerable brother. How? No clue. One of life's greatest mysteries I suppose. Not that I complain of course.

                        These 15 years have given me ample material to portray you in the most realistic way I can as your sister. You're lucky. Having a personal roastmaster. People pay fortunes you know. 
                        You have always been a <span class="rotate-object">loudmouth</span>. From when we first picked you up 14 years ago in the middle of Seoul, took you with us, tore you from whom you saw as "mother" and we had to take a taxi back to our hotel, all while our ears took the brunt of a lifetime. Poor driver. He had to listen to your crying for the entire ride. The amount of lungs a one year old can have… It's insane. The crying lasted a while, even when we arrived, but fortunately, the crying took a lot out of you and went to sleep eventually.

                        You resorted quickly to this method of… let's say expressing yourself, as with all children. It could be that you were displeased about something, could be anything by the way, to when you're happy, or sad. Whatever emotion you felt, we could tell, and hear there was something. It took you a while to understand the concept of <span class="special-text">whispering</span>. To be completely honest, I'm still unsure if it's mastered. 
                        In your early years, we would joke about how you were the epitome of "Jean qui pleure, Jean qui rit", basically that you could smoothly transition from crying to laughing in the span of ten seconds. I don't know if it's a normal thing or it's something else, but it was quite… interesting, and a bit nerve wracking to watch (poor parents).
